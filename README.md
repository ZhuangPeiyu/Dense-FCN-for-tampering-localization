# How to run
If you want to test the with trained model, just run python3 demo --filename test.py
If you want to train the model from scratchï¼Œ just run python3 demo --filename train.py

# How to test the model
python3 test.py --data_dir ./testedImages/NIST-2016/tamper/ --restore ./Models/FinetuneWithNIST-2016-56/model.ckpt-0.418555-0.753885-8 --visout_dir ./Results/NIST-2016/unthresholded --visout_threshold_dir ./Results/NIST-2016/thresholded --record_path ./Results/NIST-2016/metrics
# How to train the model
To train the network on your own dataset, do the following:
1. Clone this respository
2. Prepare your dataset with the following steps:
(1) Build the training dataset, the "./data/training_data/tamper" directory is used to store tampering images and the "./data/training_data/masks" directory is used to store ground-truths. 
(2) Build the validation dataset, the "./data/validation_data/tamper" directory is used to store tampering images and the "./data/validation_data/masks" directory is used to store ground-truths. 
3. Open up your terminal and navigate to the cloned repository
4. Type in the following:
